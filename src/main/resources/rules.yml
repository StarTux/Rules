    &9&lRule 1 &0Treat other players with &1&nrespect&0 and &1&nwelcoming&0.

    &8Personal attacks, derogatory remarks or harrassment are not tolerated. They may result in a warning or ban, depending on severity.
  - |-
    &9&lRule 2 &0No &1&ngriefing&0 or &1&nstealing&0.

    &8A player's property is theirs and may not be taken or destroyed without consent. Violations result in a ban which must be appealed in order to be lifted.
  - |-
    &9&lRule 3 &0Keep &1&nspamming&0 or &1&nprofanity&0 to a minimum.

    &8Depending on the situation, mild lapses can be tolerated. Excessive cursing or annoying spam never are, and may result in a mute or ban, depending on severity.
  - |-
    &9&lRule 4 &0No &1&noffensive builds&0, &1&nskins&0, or &1&nplayer names&0.

    &8Hateful messages or symbols, nudity, advocating drug use or violence, sexism, racism, or other kinds of bigotry, do not belong anywhere on the server.
  - |-
    &9&lRule 5 &0Do not exploit &1&nbugs&0 or use unfair &1&nmods&0.

    &8Convenience or performance mods are accepted, but nothing with a gameplay advantage over vanilla. If you find a bug, report it via /ticket or in #bugs on Discord.
  - |-
    &9&lRule 6 &0Do not take advantage of &1&nalt accounts&0.

    &8You may occasionally log in with another account, but don't take advantage of it, especially during events with per-player rewards.
  - |-
    &9&lRule 7 &0Do not cause unnecessary &1&nserver lag&0.

    &8If a build with many mobs or a lot of redstone goes out of hand, consider toning it down a little. Follow the instructions of admins. When in doubt, ask.
  - |-
    &9&lRule 8 &0No &1&nadvertising&0.

    &8You may draw attention to your builds, shops, public homes on the server, but don't spam. Advertising goods or services external to Cavetale, especially other Minecraft servers, is not allowed.
  - |-
    &9&lRule 9 &0Server language is &1&nEnglish&0.

    &8Speak so that everybody on the server can understand you. English is our common language. If you want to speak a foreign language, use private or party chat.
  - |-
    &9&lRule 10 &0Do not raid unclaimed areas in the &1&nhome worlds&0.

    &8We have a mining world which resets every week. Go do your worst in the mining worlds, but keep the home worlds pristine, unless you plan to claim your land and take care of it.
